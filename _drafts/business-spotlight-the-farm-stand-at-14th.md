<center>Have you heard of The Farm Stand at 14th? In today’s episode of our “Business Spotlight” series, we will be checking out this great new spot on the boardwalk.</center>

Today on “Business Spotlight,” we’re taking a look inside a great new restaurant: The Farm Stand at 14th.&nbsp;

The Farm Stand itself may be new, but many people here on the boardwalk have family ties in this going back for generations. Bob Harbaugh, for example, has had roots here for 90 years.&nbsp;

So with so many established businesses already here, how and why did this new restaurant come to be? Owner Becky says that **her vision for The Farm Stand was to create “a place that had healthier options for everyone**.”

And while the restaurant does offer a number of vegan options, Becky also emphasizes that everyone, regardless of lifestyle or diet, can come to The Farm Stand and enjoy a great meal.

During my visit, I was lucky enough to get a behind-the-scenes look at how they make one of their great dishes: Chef Natalie’s vegan crab cake sandwich. Check out the episode above to see this mouthwatering meal come together for yourself.

Of course, after Natalie whipped the dish up, it was time for me to dig in. Seeing the dish being prepared was one thing, but tasting it took my experience at The Farm Stand to a whole new level. Chef Natalie’s creation was absolutely delicious, and I know when all of you visit to check it out, you’ll think so too. &nbsp;

Best of all, when you visit The Farm Stand and mention our Business Spotlight while you order, you’ll get free pita and hummus as an addition to your meal. (Valid one per order)
