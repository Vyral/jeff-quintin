Have you been to Bob’s Grill yet? On today’s Business Spotlight, we’re bringing you a sneak peek into this boardwalk favorite.

On today’s Business Spotlight, we’re featuring a delicious boardwalk favorite: Bob’s Grill.

To get a better idea of what this restaurant is all about, owner Bob Harbaugh met with us to give his take. According to Bob, it all began 65 years ago when his father bought him a beach stand. Now, decades later, what was once a beach stand has grown into a rather large, very well-loved restaurant.

Of course, **our trip to Bob’s Grill wouldn’t be complete without a behind-the-scenes look of the kitchen**—where we were invited to watch Chef Tom prepare a boardwalk classic: the lobster roll. You can see this delicious dish come together for yourself in the video above.

But as awesome as this sandwich looks, it tastes even better. So make sure to come down to the boardwalk sometime soon and try it out yourself. We guarantee you won’t regret it.
