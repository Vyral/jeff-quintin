<center><em>Bowfish turns kids&rsquo; imaginations into reality, and today we&rsquo;re going to show you how they do it.</em></center>

&nbsp;

As a father of three daughters, I’m always trying to make things special for my kids. That’s why on today’s "Business Spotlight," we’re featuring a great local business: Bowfish Kids.

**Bowfish has both a retail store and an Imagination Studio where, according to owner Caitlin Quirk, children and adults alike can go to bring their imaginations to life**.

In the studio, guests are transformed into a character or creature of their choosing (whether it’s a mermaid, unicorn, shark, pirate, or a hybrid between these things) with the help of one of Bowfish’s imagination stylists. It’s all about the kids and their experience.

During our behind-the-scenes look in Bowfish’s studio today, we got a glimpse at how these transformations play out. **Harper, our mermaid star for today’s "Business Spotlight," got her hair, nails, and makeup done, and was even outfitted with a tail to complete the look**.

Seeing the experience they provide here at Bowfish was incredible. If you have kids of your own, Bowfish could be the perfect place to make your next special occasion a little more so.

**You can learn more about Bowfish by [visiting their website](https://www.bowfishkids.com/)**.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
