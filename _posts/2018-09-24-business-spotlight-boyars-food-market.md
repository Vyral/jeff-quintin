<center><em>On today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Business Spotlight&rdquo; I am taking you to 13th and Asbury to show you Boyar&rsquo;s Food Market.</em></center>

&nbsp;

If you're looking for quality food in an old-school butcher environment, then Boyar's Food Market at 1340 Asbury Avenue is the place to go. According to Gail, one of the owners, the market was first opened in 1942 by Louis and Mary Boyar. Since then, it has evolved into the wonderful place I’ll be highlighting in today’s “Business Spotlight.”

**Boyar’s Market specializes in fresh meat with an on-site butcher ready to cut your meat to order**. They also have a fresh deli with quality meats at affordable prices. Gail tells me that their party tray selection is one of the largest in the area.

Beyond meats, they offer an amazing selection of freshly prepared food for takeout. Today's fresh Jersey corn, bruschetta chicken, pork tenderloin, and carrots and green beans all look delicious. Designed for the busy-minded person who wants a homemade meal, customers can grab what they want and be on their way quickly.

Their takeout menu has many different items available, like soups, sandwiches, and pastas. I was lucky enough to have Gail show me how she makes the roast pork, broccoli rabe, and sharp provolone cheese with gravy sandwich from scratch. She starts by slicing the homemade roast pork, then grills it with the broccoli rabe and gravy, before melting the provolone cheese over the top and placing it into a roll.

This special sub was brought to Ocean City by Gail's business partners, Robert, Bobby, and Scott—it was their favorite. I can personally attest to it being absolutely delicious; you can definitely taste all the flavors.

**Open daily at 9 AM, Boyar's Market closes at 7:30 PM Sunday through Thursday and 8 PM on Fridays and Saturdays**. [Click here](http://www.boyarsmarket.com/take-out.htm) if you'd like to take a look at all their delicious menu items.
