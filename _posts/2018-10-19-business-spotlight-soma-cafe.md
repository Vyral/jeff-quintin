One of my favorite parts of being a Realtor is that I’m constantly out and about, interacting with our community. Today, to get a taste of our fine local eateries, I went to visit a local restaurant and see what they’re all about. **Today I’m at Soma Cafe for this episode of "Business Spotlight."**

With comfort food, a healthy twist, and cool vibe, Soma Cafe in downtown Ocean City is the place to be. But first of all, what does “Soma” even mean? I sat down with the owner, Sam, to get some answers.

**Soma** is an acronym, standing for **S**imple, **O**rganic, **M**indful **A**lignment. It describes both the food as well as the restaurant’s space itself. After living abroad for a few years, Sam returned and wanted to provide something unique to Ocean City—and unique is definitely a good way to describe the selection of food.

“I really wanted to make something that has choices for everybody,” Sam explained in regard to the menu. **Soma Cafe offers options for vegetarians, vegans, and meat lovers; there’s something for everyone**. There are also a variety of great coffees to enjoy.

Perhaps one of the most popular items at the cafe, the Soma Grilled Cheese is made of organic whole-grain bread, homemade spreads (hummus, whipped goat cheese, ginger dressing), feta cheese, and some veggies. The cheeses are not only delicious but also healthier alternatives to normal grilled-cheese fare. After a quick grill on a panini press, the Soma Grilled Cheese is ready to be devoured.

If you find yourself in downtown Ocean City, the Soma Cafe is definitely a place you’ll want to check out.
